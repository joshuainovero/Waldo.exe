New Game Start:
Hello there, gamer! My name is Waldo, and I'm from the Land of Waldos, a land populated by Waldos just like me.
You've probably come across me in one of your books where I'm hidden in various pages. You had a hard time finding me before, didn't you?
Anyways, I am always ready for an adventure with my walking stick in hand, and my trusty dog Woof by my side.
I've gotten a little more sophisticated, and I'm now lurking and hidden behind your computer screen.
The rule is straightforward gamer. All you have to do is to find me on each map of the game. Simple isn't it?
Be sure to find me before the clock runs out or else there will be consequences. Best of luck gamer!
